## Usage

Please see the [API reference](API.md) for detailed usage information and
examples.

#### Using in Node.js < 0.12

This module requires a Promise implementation to exist in the global namespace
prior to being loaded. Therefore, to facilitate use on versions of Node.js
before 0.12, you are responsible for providing a polyfill. I recommend
[es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise).

##### Example:

```javascript
// This must be first!
require('es6-promise').polyfill();

var hibp = require('hibp');
```

#### Using in the browser

As stated above, this module requires a Promise implementation to exist in the
global namespace prior to being loaded. Therefore, to facilitate usage on
[browsers without native Promise support](http://caniuse.com/#search=promise),
you are responsible for providing a polyfill. Again, I recommend
[es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise).

To use hibp in the browser, you have a few options:

* Pull it in via CDN (this will reference the `latest` tag version by default,
  but you can specify a particular version if desired - see
  [unpkg](https://unpkg.com) for details):

  ```html
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/hibp/lib/hibp.min.js"></script>
  ```

  The `hibp` object should now be added to the browser's `window` object and
  ready for use.

* Grab the browser/minified version from `node_modules/hibp/lib/hibp.min.js`
  (or [download it from the CDN](https://unpkg.com/hibp/lib/hibp.min.js)) and
  reference directly in a `<script>` tag. The `hibp` object should now be added
  to the browser's `window` object and ready for use.

* Bundle it in with client-side code with a module bundler like
  [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). If your build process honors the
  `browser` field in `package.json`, you can import or require it normally:

  ```javascript
  // ES2015
  import hibp from 'hibp';

  // ES5
  var hibp = require('hibp');
  ```

  If your build process does not respect the `browser` field of `package.json`,
  you may explicitly include or require the pre-compiled/minified browser
  version like so:

  ```javascript
  // ES2015
  import hibp from 'hibp/lib/hibp.min';

  // ES5
  var hibp = require('hibp/lib/hibp.min');
  ```
